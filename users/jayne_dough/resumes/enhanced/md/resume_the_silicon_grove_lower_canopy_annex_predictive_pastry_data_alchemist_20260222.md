## Project Experience

### Customer Churn Prediction Model
Designed and productionized an end-to-end gradient-boosted classification model (XGBoost) to predict monthly subscriber churn across a 2M-customer SaaS platform, owning the full ML lifecycle from feature engineering via raw SQL event logs through hyperparameter tuning, Docker-based deployment, and a Grafana dashboard for real-time monitoring — directly paralleling the supply chain anomaly dashboards and predictive forecasting this role requires. Collaborated with cross-functional teams to operationalize intervention workflows triggered by model scores, reducing customer attrition by 12% in Q1 2024 and saving 8 hours per week of manual analyst work, demonstrating the precision-oriented, data-driven approach central to predictive pastry optimization.

### Real-Time Fraud Detection System
Architected a streaming fraud detection platform on Apache Kafka and Flink, processing 50K transactions per minute at under 100ms P99 latency, building ensemble models (LightGBM combined with a rule engine) trained on three years of historical data — a methodology closely aligned with the role's requirement to utilize historical sales data for forecasting festival pastry demand and flagging supply anomalies in real time. Designed a Redis-backed feature store for low-latency serving and worked closely with operations teams to tune precision and recall thresholds, catching 34% more fraudulent transactions versus the legacy system while reducing the false-positive rate by 18%, reflecting the precision-orientation and anomaly-flagging capabilities sought for tracking dragon-fire yeast and stardust inventory flows.

### NLP-Powered Support Ticket Classifier
Fine-tuned a DistilBERT model on 200K labeled support tickets to classify intent and route tickets automatically, achieving 91% accuracy and reducing average handle time by 25%, with a Looker dashboard tracking routing accuracy and queue volume by category for clear stakeholder communication — directly relevant to the sentiment analysis and visual storytelling requirements of this role. Implemented an active learning loop allowing domain experts to flag mispredictions feeding back into monthly retraining, improving accuracy by 4 percentage points over six months, and deployed a FastAPI inference service on GCP Cloud Run with auto-scaling, demonstrating the end-to-end analytical and communication pipeline needed to translate kingdom-wide craving signals from the bird-song network into actionable weekly bake-list adjustments.
