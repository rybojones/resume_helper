## Project Experience

### Customer Churn Prediction Model
Designed and productionized an end to end churn prediction pipeline that reduced customer attrition by 12 percent through the deployment of an XGBoost classification model. Owned the full machine learning lifecycle including feature engineering from raw SQL logs and Docker based deployment for a 2M customer platform. Implemented a Grafana dashboard for ongoing monitoring and worked with stakeholders to operationalize model scores into intervention workflows, showcasing a commitment to creative data science solutions and production model maintenance.

### Real-Time Fraud Detection System
Architected a real time streaming fraud detection system on AWS utilizing Apache Kafka and Flink to process 50K transactions per minute. Built ensemble models including LightGBM trained on a 3 year history to catch 34 percent more fraudulent transactions compared to legacy systems. Developed a feature store backed by Redis for low latency serving and designed an analyst facing review queue for monitoring, demonstrating deep machine learning expertise and the ability to deliver high impact technical solutions on cloud infrastructure.

### NLP-Powered Support Ticket Classifier
Developed a fine tuned BERT based intent classifier to auto route 70 percent of incoming support tickets with 91 percent accuracy. Built and deployed a FastAPI inference service with auto scaling that reduced average handle time by 25 percent. Created an active learning loop for continuous model improvement based on agent feedback and delivered a Looker dashboard for tracking performance, reflecting a love for data science and experience with end to end model deployment and monitoring.
